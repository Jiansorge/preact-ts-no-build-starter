# preact-ts-no-build-starter
A very simple starter for small js apps, no build step required.

-  [preact](https://preactjs.com/) for state & event handling
-  [htm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htm) for jsx-like syntax

---

### Development tips:
 - `npx servor --browse --reload` will launch a hot-reloading local [servor](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/servor).
 - VSCode has nice auto-formatting.
