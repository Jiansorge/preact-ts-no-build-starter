# preact-ts-no-build-starter

A very simple starter for small js apps, no build step required.

- [preact](https://preactjs.com/) for state & event handling
- [htm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htm) for jsx-like syntax

---

## Development tips

- `npx servor --browse --reload` will launch a hot-reloading local [servor](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/servor).
- VSCode has nice auto-formatting.

Preact no-build starter forked from [this repo](https://github.com/LukeStorry/simplest-starter).
Inspired by [this](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/no-build-step/) article.
